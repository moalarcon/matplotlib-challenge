Observations:

1) The drug Capomulin seems to be the most effective and efficient drug in the sample of treatements. Animals tested with this drug had the highest survival rate and lowest rate of metastatic spread among the sample of animals tested. They also experienced the most significant response to treatment (with a survival rate between 80-85%) and displaying the only observed decrease in average tumor volume.

2) Ketapril, on the other hand, seems to have a negative effect overall and encourage tumor volume growth more than all other treatments. While these adverse effects aren't so noticable at first, towards the end of the treatment phase the rate of metastatic spread increases at a quicker rate than all other treatments (including placebo). 

3)Infubinol, while shown to decrease metastatic spread, has the lowest rate of survival during treatment and the least smooth decline in this respect as well.
